/// A utility class for generating thumbnails from video files and byte arrays.
///
/// This class provides a simple and efficient way to generate thumbnails from video files and byte arrays.
/// It supports various image formats, including PNG, JPG, and WebP, and allows for customization of the thumbnail's size, quality, and timestamp.
/// The generated thumbnails can be saved to a file or returned as a `Uint8List` for further processing.
///
/// Note that this class uses platform-specific implementations to generate thumbnails, which ensures optimal performance and compatibility.
